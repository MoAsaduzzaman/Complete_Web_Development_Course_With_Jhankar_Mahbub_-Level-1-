    <!-- Inline -->
    Inline elements are those elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They typically flow within the content and do not create a new "block" or line. Inline elements are often used for small units of content or elements that should appear within a line of text.

    <!-- Block -->
    Block elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and take up the full width available. They create a "block" or box-like structure, pushing subsequent elements onto a new line. Block elements are commonly used for structural elements like paragraphs, headings, and divisions.
