    <!-- Anchor Tag(a) -->
    <h3>Anchor Tag(a)</h3>
    <p>In HTML, the anchor tag is used to create hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are elements that allow you to navigate to another document, resource, or location on the same page or a different one. The anchor tag is versatile and widely used for creating links in web pages.</p>

    <!-- Attributes(href,target) -->
    <h3>Attributes(href,target)</h3>
    <p>In HTML, attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are added to the opening tag of an element and are always included in the form of name/value pairs. Attributes can influence the behavior, appearance, or functionality of an element</p>

    <!-- href -->
    <h3>href</h3>
    <p>The href attribute is commonly used with the anchor tag and specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to which the link points.</p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">I want to go Youtube</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">I want to go Linkedin</a>

    <!-- target -->
    <h3>target</h3>
    <p>The target attribute is often used with the anchor tag as well and specifies where to open the linked document. Common values include _blank (open in a new tab or window) and _self (open in the same frame or tab).</p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">I want to go Youtube</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">I want to go Linkedin</a>
